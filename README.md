# chatbot
Explorations in building a chatbot in JavaScript.

Uses a Vue frontend to allow users to submit questions and will display responses depending on what bot is being used.

Built a response generator based on parsed Reddit comments. Pushshift.IO API retreives queries based on question parameters, and ensuing comments are cleaned and return randomly.

Built a markov chain generator based on Pride and Prejudice. Depending on the nGrams model used (biGrams vs triGrams), model will return a sentence generated by probabilities of word combinations.

Implemented the Brain.js module to build and LSTM that trains itself on Reddit Parent/Child comments as response/answer data.
