 orry it sounded like bragging, my point was that it has been available on that site from a long time, and  aul apparently didn't know that.  ead his manifesto. ollow his links.  t's always easier to get forgiveness than permission  ilarious. these guy sure are paying for shit tons of 'press releases'  he top blogging blogs reddit is  what's new online  not  rate the web o i for my part will demote anything old like this article.   wouldn't advocate doing stuff you're not at all interested in.   f there are several things you could do that users want, do the one you'll like most.   ust don't lie to yourself about whether users want it.   or example, the main reason  iaweb ended up being server based was that we didn't want to have to write  indows apps.   ut it was also a win for users  we weren't just doing it to suit our own tastes.  reen ap is a known scam   want the bit about the  ie  allacy  to be taught to children as soon as they can tell nickels from pennies.  nd then repeated daily until they start   their own kind of wealth. he  ie  allacy  is hopeless and idiotic, but it's by far the most common economic thinking.  ould somebody loop over these files and put them somewhere more publicly accesible?

like you there are others that have these visions in this evolving age of mobile phone design and the need to improve the old ways or to come up with a fresh new idea or stylish design.  obile phone producing companies are always looking for new ideas, the next trends or hype if you want to call it that.  hat if you can make an effort to put something new out there?  ould you be interested?   es,   think entrepreneurship can be taught, just like anything else.   e teach it at    ombinator.   he problem is just that most of the people teaching it at universities don't have any first hand experience of it. ow well a university can teach a subject depends on whether the teachers are the leading practitioners of it.   o colleges are good at teaching physics and medicine, beause the best physicists and doctors are professors  they're somewhat less good at teaching programming because the best hackers don't necessarily become professors  and they're terrible at teaching literature or entrepreneurship, because good writers and startup founders actively avoid becoming professors.   nteresting to see how this site is going to develop  nteresting site.  ts sort of the  ikipedia of factoids  hile it may seem self evident that you create wealth by providing something people want, many business people forget this fact. ome years ago,   turned to the dark side and got an   from  arvard  usiness  chool.   n my classes,   learned a lot about creating and capturing value.   ssentially, we're told that value equals the difference between willingness to pay and production cost. he problem is that this equation reduces wealth to simple arithmetic, and encourages you to treat product creation as a simple case of lowering costs or increasing prices.  started several businesses that focused on slicing and dicing cashflows and incentives.   hile they had some success at making money,   wasn't really creating wealth.    was just coming up with other ways to slice up the pie. 've seen the light since then, but a lot of other  suits  have not.   'm glad  aul made this essay available to the general public.   aybe it will help other people come to the same realization.  his doesn't work.  here is an interesting phenomenon occurring at reddit whereby the majority left leaning denizens of the sight are slowly alienating the minority right leaning ones like myself.   he only question   have is why do   care?   'm not sure why   care if a story about some idiotic  talian magistrates gets voted up to the top of the 'hot' list, but   do.   'm starting to feel like   don't fit in here.   aybe you should change the name to 'blueit'.  elicous sounding crab cakes!   don't agree with the last comment.   he academic life is quite structured and formulaic  publish or perish, tenure, politics, grant writing,...   could go on.   t has been falsely romanticised by  ollywood on more than one occasion.  think you can sow the seeds of a startup while at university  because that is where many great, revolutionary ideas originate as a result of the interactions between faculty and students but you cannot run a company because your responsibilities as a professor are all consuming.         everal of those are  's.   erhaps they didn't want search engines to index dead pages.  he number of promotions this article is getting shows how much people love anything controversial, even if the controversy is unfounded.  gt   f people use the internet to reinforce their pre existing views, then it is only because people don't actively seek to debunk what they believe.  he technology forces nothing upon them. our proved his point exactly.  eople don't like to seek out stuff that will change their views.  o they go to online communities that fit their view, and they only become further entrenched in it.  here as in real life, you are often forced into situations where you must deal with people of different views and behaviors, with the  nternet and technology, you can go to these little islands of behavior and never see people who disagree with your mindset again.  hus it is technology which leads people to be like that.  oogle has been doing these forever. funny and creative stuff yesss!  onnegut writes hey have had to throw away their educations, even  arvard or  ale educations, to become guessers.  f they didn't do that, there is no way their uninhibited guessing could go on and on and on. n alternative erhaps  arvard and  ale aren't discouraging  guessing  as much as we'd like to think?   hy assume that all of these powerful, well educated  mericans have thrown away what they've learned?   aybe they're actually applying it.  ny site that has a  email this page to a friend  is likely harvesting email address for spamming.   his site, on their home page, says  get paid cash to submit content to e aum's  orld.  e are seeking original content submissions.     o they can get traffic to sucker people into giving up friends email addresses.    heard that the  ozilla  oundation might be close to adopting  pera as one of its projects.  hat was mildly incoherent.   nyone catch  onnegut on the  aily  how?   he man has lost it, unfortunately.   ry reading  at's  radle, a work more worthy of  onnegut's name than some heavily edited, senile musings.  t's especially apparent with the gentrification of  pitalfields market. just awful.  ibertarianism is not a political position.  t is more an expression of arrested development.  hildren and teenagers always think that their feelings and what they want to do are the most important things in the world.  elf sacrifice and a notion of being part of a greater society that come with growing up a bit are incompatible with the basic thrusts of libertarianism as   see it.  ost people who call themselves libertarians seem to be unwittingly using it as a figleaf for being fantastically shallow and selfish.  he closest political position to libertarianism is probably the anarchist one.  ow do  oly  ars  like emacs vs. vi,  indows vs.  inux, ... fit into this idea?  houldn't the different camps in those just use different sites if his assumptions are correct?   think different things keep writers and founders away.   riters are kept away because they could not stand talking about literature in the way  nglish professors do it.  ounders are kept away because they don't need the money, and because if they were going to teach about startups, the way to do it would be out in the field, as angel investors, not in some room full of people who'll never actually start companies.  uesses are decisions made without sufficient information.  hat's the main challenge of public policy everyday   lobal warming   otential pandemics   ecurity threats ven budgets and economics are subject to high degrees of uncertainty.  ometimes you have to act now, and see if you were right or wrong later once the full picture becomes available.  gt  not sure why   care if a story about some idiotic  talian magistrates t's strange that this kind of head in the sand dismissal of the international picture has become associated with the right.  t seems to really weaken their hand.   have read that there is a belief in the   gov decision making process along the lines that because the   is so powerful, they now create history and don't really have to worry about international concerns and historical precedents.  hat country am   in again?  ay to do this when nobody is looking. actually, as a lifelong atheist, i think it might be a good idea to have an official state church in the  . a single officially recognized, state funded, church denomination that was considered the  default religion  for anybody who didn't choose to opt out of it and pick another   would have to cater to everyone, could not afford to discriminate or act too fundamentalist crazy. it would have to be a church for the whole people, and therefore couldn't make enemies of anybody, really. and because it'd be the largest religion by far, it   with its necessary tolerance   would become the standard for other denominations to be judged by. an association with the state would tame religion, i think. or, since this  is  the   we're talking about, maybe it would destroy the state. politics here have a way of being bass ackwards a lot of the time.  what about  onsumerism as the new religion?  can see it now   uying is the new tithe   o true   but jeez i had to fight an urge to believe that it didnt apply to me  he worst form of procrastination   face is thinking without acting  reading things on  eddit, reading programming language manuals, and walking around my apartment with a cup of coffee or a beer.  fter reading this essay,   don't think the way to combat this type of procrastination is to stop thinking, but rather to put a limit on how long you let yourself think without acting. ou should know how to  implement  quickly in your field.  or programming, that means actually writing code.  or writing, that means getting words down on a page.  n science, it must be conducting an experiment, no matter how shoddy. rogrammers and artists are blessed because they have easy ways to sketch.  ll fields have ways to sketch, though  someone looking to fix the  . . healthcare system could create a simulation, or see how there plans would impact five different people that they know. e all want to do great things.  nd we should. you know,   like  aul  rahams stuff.  'm not one of these people who dislike him because he's successful or because he's popular.  nterestingly he wrote an essay on  eing  opular, but it was talking about quite the opposite.  ow he's popular, does that cause problems?  nyway,  've decided to register with  eddit and post something, but only because  'm avoiding doing this particular piece of work     s  've said,   like  auls work,     just get the feeling that its waning   his earlier stuff was was a real  wow  factor for me as it was exactly what  'd been thinking and mirrored what we were doing.  hat   read now is  ok  but   don't send it to all my friends and print it to make my wife read it.  m   the only one who feels like this?  m stunned to think that people dont understand how unjust the death penalty is and how there is no risk too small to a conviction that an innocent person may die.  ove this article!  ts an oldish one from  aul  raham, very good nonetheless  n article on  icro  conomics by  oel  polsky  hanks for the reply  aul.   noticed that change from  hat we did and did right  to  what we're doing .   don't even blog, so maybe a little unfair to post what   did   however it was an observation from my own that   used to enthuse about your essays.  his particular one was interesting though, but unlike the earlier ones   think what was missing was the 'how to' element. ake care.    uines that are based on reading the file are classed as cheating  here's another kind of time wasting errand  the recurring errand.  hat makes it special is that you can't really be more productive by doing it sooner, or more often.  ake mowing the lawn.  ou can't mow five times harder and then not need to mow it for a longer period.  he same goes with cleaning. omething else   've found that not watching   has been a huge time gain.  e chose not to have cable in our house.  f   accidentally play a computer game for   hours, instead of one, it's no big deal.  hen we do watch  , we watch  s of series that have been pre filtered by our friends.   agree with you.   things which don't feel like revelations can also be extremely important.  fter all, you can't be a great hacker if you keep wasting your time on errands    eep writing,  aul.  his story seems fishy.   o what if a free xbox were to be taxable?   e's a billionaire  he can afford to pay the tax. ...from  !  an someone explain to me why this is important?   hat is, other than to impresss someone with how much you can drink, which means you are childish or have serious self image problems.   his essay is right on the mark.   can't even count the number of times a day   feel pangs of guilt for not doing what   should be doing...and  'm working   hours a week in a fledgling two man startup. hose three types of procrastination are not the only ones   find, however.  ike bugs in programming, there can be compound procrastination too.  ometime's   find myself procrastinating from working on a hard problem by reading  eddit or  lashdot...but in reality the reason  'm reading is so that   don't feel guilty about not doing chores and can have more time to do real work. erhaps my extremes are a special case, however.  n my freshman year of high school, when a particularly stern teacher stated flatly that no essay would be accepted late unless someone was suffering from a serious illness.   was bold enough to raise my hand and patiently wait to ask the question,  is procrastination a serious illness? 'm still not sure if   was really kidding.  'm was meant to be wrapping  hristmas presents this evening but was buzy procrastination reading about procrastination  awn.   just don't get this guy at all.   find that the least productivity damaging way to deal with errands is to put all of them off until some one errand can no longer wait, and then do them all at once.   n other words, apply a greedy algorithm to the fewest interruptions problem.  ometimes, if most of the errands are sufficiently mindless, they become a type productive block of time in themselves because while  'm doing them   can still mull over hard problems in the back of my mind.  ownload rest of article in .zip format   immediate dislike.  i'm amazed that people can still believe that killing people in order to prove that killing people is wrong, is right. to me, it's not even about justice or the risk for mistakes  it's about what should or should not be acceptable for the rest of us   the  good guys , the part of society who don't go committing serious crimes   to do. i simply do not agree that killing is or should be acceptable, other than in self defense, no matter what the intended victim may have done. even if they deserve to die, that shouldn't be enough to give us the right to kill. if it does, then who's to say that what qualifies as  deserving to die  won't start changing shape over time...?  n interesting example  apparently  ndrew  ridgell wrote  amba as a means of procrastination when working on his doctoral thesis, rsync.   n reality, both of them are projects that anyone would be proud to call their own, because he's a brilliant hacker. loser to home, my wife doesn't find reading  aul's articles or reddit a good excuse for not washing the dishes, so off   go.   was about to start playing with  ails.  rom what   read its good for quick, fast sites but not for major ones.  ould this be right in thinking?   was about to start playing with  ails.  rom what   read its good for quick, fast sites but not for major ones.  ould this be right in thinking?  here's nothing wrong with modding up a piece such as the original.  r even questioning the set of laws that would have made the investigation of a student's library record possible.  he problem only comes if people refuse to revise their opinions after the truth comes out.  hat was the case about?  ho was being sued, for what?  ot much news in this alleged news story.  ard to believe,   know, but the linked article actually explains that!   ou should give it a read.  fter reading some of the replies in this post,   get the feeling that some people are taking this article as an excuse to stop doing important things and instead focus on misguided things. eah, skipping doing some random things here and there while you work on what you hope will be a successful startup one day is great, but what happens if that startup is a colossal failure?  sn't that putting all your eggs in one basket?   don't think work has to be bone crushingly insightful to be valuable.   t helps to have it written out so you can keep reading what you already know.  eh.   think the people saying that  aul  raham is popular and famous might wanna compare him to the 'celebritys' constantly blasted at us on the   for a while and ponder.  e entertain's me, and the reddit crowd seem to like him but nobody else has ever heard of him for heavens sake. rocrastination, yeah.  ell   tried not mowing the lawn.  urns out the neighbours would rather complain while pushing thier own mower over it than they would knock on my door and ask me to mow it myself. ot that   own a mower or anything.  tupid bit of grass.   wanna pave it over with a giant chessboard really, but   can't afford it.  eah, to reiterate that point,   had never heard of  aul  raham until   started getting into  eddit.  s writing an essay on procastination really the hardest problem in  aul  raham's field?    urprisingly inspiring stuff.  feel much better over the  fear of wasting time  on the big things now.   think that holds me back.  ut now   think about it, it never is wasted.  nd it rarely fails   at worst the problem will morph into something solvable, or else perhaps it wasn't meant to be solved anyway. yeah   didn't think the essay addressed the  perspiration  versus inspiration part.  ou do need to do the last   often times.   guess the trick is to keep the momentum from the first  .  t's probably significantly less hard than finishing  rc. lol!  his post was awesome.  ow... uite the rebuttal to his entire article, isn't it?  acros are like sperm.  hey are different when they are your own. nd people keep talking about the   mess like its  .  et over it.  ow is he wrong?   hat kinda doesn't really say anything at all the author makes several points in his article.  ooh  'm a  sharecropper , woe is me. hat a load.   his is a hoax,  .  lean and money saving technologies.  or me, and a number of people   know,  aul  raham is the reason   have heard of reddit, not the other way round.    think   heard of him through slashdot a couple of years back, and have regularly checked his site for updates ever since.    imagine that reddit's success in quickly creating a wide reaching community is largely due to the links  aul has put on his site.  his is a great article on self imposed constrains in web design.  h yeah,  've been reading his essays since   started trying to learn lisp a while back.  e is, nevertheless, not famous.  h yes.  hat's the point in drinking alchohol if one wants to stay sober anyway?  t can hardly be the good taste of it, or am   missing something?  lso, he talks about eating potatoes and raw eggs and stuff, but what's really in them that prevents you from getting drunk?  he medical explaination.  t boils down to two problems irst is discipline.  ou need it to switch from   to    rocrastination. econd is  isdom.  ou need it to distuingish between   and   jobs. but, the common wisdom is that if u eat beforehand, it'll take longer for the alcohol to even get to your bloodstream.  i personally believe this to be true just by personal experience    his seems less like an experiment to find out if that a means to provoke into  he author's hypothesis is that  ython is not growing towards  isp, and that it shouldn't.  he former is undoubtedly true, the latter will always be up for debate.  o one can agree on the terms of the debate, though, so it will likely remain an unproductive argument. rescod makes several unsubstantiated claims, in particular that an object is a  better  abstraction than a function, and that programmers do not like deeply nested expressions.  he former statement strikes me as meaningless  some will program just as well with functions as others will with objects.  he latter observation hints at the strange element of  isp syntax that differentiates it from other programming languages  deeply nested expressions. gt   ost other languages don't have as many parentheses.  ost other languages do not use prefix syntax.  lancing over a sheet of  isp code and a sheet of  ython code, what will strike you most is the difference in indentation.  he  ython code will have several more sections of statements at the same indentation level. rescod claims that most programmers prefer this type of indentation.  f course, he has no data to back up this claim.   suspect that most programmers do like  ython indentation more than they like  isp indentation.  he comparison is unfair, however, since most hackers start programming in a language other than  isp.  reat article,   read it back in   when it came out, but   don't know why the guy rips it off of  alon and doesn't give credit.  y respect for  ourtney  ove just went up several notches. encryption is your friend.  ow, the experts, the insiders, the well connected are all wondering   ow bad is it, really?  he consensus is   retty bad.  nd domestic surveillance not this  foreign  figleaf is almost certainly involved.  ddly enough, yes, it's one of them.    deliberately decided to focus on writing essays in  .   t seems to me a fairly hard problem, to try to get to the bottom of questions a lot of people have wondered about.  his is five years old?  hat's pretty sad...  ssholism in    asy  teps.  nice!  ou know whats procrastination?  itting in front of your machine all day long doing nothing but reading all the  hot  articles on reddit.  'm voting this down just because   find it unacceptable to start reading opinion in the title of the link.  oes not work if you have  ebsense.   uch low ratings.. oes the reddit crowd not care to learn new things?  olving   is important, but only if we can do something useful with that solution.  hat would we be able to do if we knew  ?  reak encryption algorithms?  chedule resources more effectively?  wouldn't wait around for people to agree on what the most important problems are.  ick a problem, think of some solutions, and get cracking. y guess is that the solution to   will fall out of working on a specific hard problem.  ttack it from an angle.  ery interesting.   might be wrong, however, but it seems that many of his assertions about  udeo hristian  seem to be only the ideas of  hristianity, not  udaism at all.  ntersting site picks new tools for online publishing and collaboration each week, with something extra special for this xmas  ind of crazy that they ended up mowing each other down only a few days later. amen to that.  ld news...  ould you all please provide some links to videos one can actually watch?

f you develop for  inux, you support  inux and help  inux be more popular. f you develop for  indows, you support  indows and help  indows be more popular. ho profits from  indows?  icrosoft.   company which at least pay a lot of programmers to work on  indows. ho profits from  inux?

 odka is truly at the core of  ussian society...  nly questions, no answers ... bleh  hame,  , for having the death penalty!  ho?   itle makes no sense  it should be  ass  irtual  istraction or  ass  istraction.  ll the 'virtual' does is to say people are distracted not by the real world but online.  nd there   was going around in circles wondering what it means to virtualize distraction.  ow is this not bank fraud?  ood, another  onday morning quarterback...  s  eb  .  all about pulling your language out of your pants and waving it at everyone? lalala  his is why we can't use common sense anymore  there's always some guy who'll try to exploit any possible loophole. f course,   would do the same thing he did, no question about it.  f you read the link, you'll see how it's not bank fraud, or at least not the intent to defraud.  hen  'm working on a hard problem and   figure something out,   stop.   should just write the code, but   'reward' myself by taking a break, or having lunch or running an errand content that   know how to solve the problem.  hen it comes time to implement the solution, it's no longer an interesting problem so it becomes a chore...which is exactly what   need when   hit the next brick wall.  nd so it proceeds.  he path between me and my goals is a roller coaster.  nd a to do list is not a good leveling algorithm.  ink to the source article or no vote from me.  ood  ewsweek story.  ur machine is mostly made of connections,   avid said.  bout ninety per cent of its volume is cables.  our brain is the same way.  t is mostly made of connections.  f   may say so, your brain is a liquid cooled parallel supercomputer.   e pointed to his nose  his is the fan.  this guy is evil  e banked a check from a get rich quick marketing scheme.  he get rich quick company had accidentally designed a real check, and sent it out to thousands of people.  his particular recipient banked it, and the bank were obliged to pay it.  he bank transferred the money from the sender's account to the recipient.  here's the fraud?  h yeah, he ruthlessly took advantage of a poor defenceless, get rich quick scheme.  he marketing company was trying to exploit a loophole by sending out realistic checks with  non negotiable  printed on them.  hey hadn't researched their loophole properly and had actually been sending out real checks.  his is a victory for common sense   don't send out checks unless you want to them to be cashed .  hat's the great thing about these little experiments   t does not matter what the author thinks about topics unrelated to the experiment.   t does not matter if he is a nice guy or not.   t's really about the data.  here are important exceptions.   xception driven jobs like taking care of small children, cops and firemen answering emergency calls, emergency room doctors, and soldiers on the battlefield.   dditional exceptions are all the kids in elementary and high school  there entire lives are taken up with preparation that lasts, subjectively, for an infinite time. eah, taking care of your kids or rescuing somebody could be  he most important use of your time , but it's not the kind of hard problem  aul is talking about. ociety needs the  edex delivery and the folks who read the meters, the toll takers and the street sweepers.   ven as these jobs are being automated the category is required and new ones pop up.   bout half the population is below average in ability   what  should they do?  really impressed by  aul's article. really regret not so much people have seen this or just not post comments on this. undoubtedly  aul give us many points concerning how to make wealth and rich.   like   and doesn't like complicated relationship here in  hina. that's why   appreicate this article much more. though  aul 's article may have some limits due to based on his experience in programming, you must admit  aul's  genius in so many fields.  wonder someday could   be  aul's   agent in  hina?  teve is also a polyphasic sleeper, sleeping just   hours per day and only   minutes at a time.  o chances are good that he's awake right now. from the about page  men to that!  n your example, the users of your   procedure now need to know that in order to make a counter, they need to call  .  hat's an ugly exposure of implementation detail.  hat happens when you re write   using closures to preserve state? ell then maybe the person who wrote   should create a procedure like  , which calls   for the user.  ut then everyone who writes a generator needs to write a constructor procedure.  mm. ow could we solve this problem?   macro perhaps?   here are still some  raham pages left to be posted on reddit?  y husband could have written that article himself...if he had deemed it worthy of the time.   s the wife of a developer, start up guy and good procrastinator,  'm the one left to do the interruptive  errands  in our life.  t often means   become the bad procrastinator working on keeping up with the kids, laundry, job, etc instead of my thesis.   ou really have to be a extremely patient friend, neighbor or spouse to one of these driven people.   et's hope it pays off for all of us in the end!  ow often would you want to expose the implementation details of  ?  lmost never.  o why do you want a programmer who writes a generator to almost always define a constructor procedure? n a few hours   created a generator facility that feels at least as  baked in  as  ython's.  hat wouldn't be possible without a little macro magic.  s there a better interface for generators?  re generators a good idea?  s there a better abstraction for solving these sorts of problems?  'm glad   use a language that allows other people to easily explore these questions.  here was an article about the pill up earlier, thought this made a good complement to it. another nice way to procrastinate!!  ight on  aul!   'll have more comments later but  'm putting them off while   go pour a cup of coffee, post to my blog, fix a couple websites and a leaky door.  uplicate    love this article.   ou might also read the  lazy way to success , similar concept.    have been the biggest procrastinator.   nd everytime it has payed off.    think it is a mark of ability if you can finish up your responsibilties in a day or two and then focus on the cool stuff the rest of the time.  enowned security analyst speaks.   knew that was going to happen  .  'm not sure how   missed the remake of  he  exas  hainsaw  assacre's rating, but of course  bert reviews so many movies and   wouldn't go looking for that movie's review, knowing it was bad already.  still think this is a first for  bert though.  ven  he  exas  hainsaw  assacre's review didn't say that the movie was so horrific that it crossed any sort of line.  e is disparaging of  , yes, but not abhorrent.  t least that's my take    his text an instant inspiring one.   am recommending it to my cared friends. hanks for writing  it shot me right on the spot. just a great article.   love to read and see stuff like that.  ts where we are too   trying to create a good, niche product that people like.   loved the graph for how well it was doing too! it's strangely mesmerizing to watch the patterns, then set fire to the oil  hey end the paper with a disturbing apples to oranges comparison, it appears   he event based web server is running on a  , and the thread based one is running in  .  uess which one runs out of resources first!    pinch of addiction, two tbsp of distraction....delicious!   have read quite a few of  aul  raham's essays and   have also read his book  ackers and  ainters .   have to say that   agree with most of what he writes.  he problem with the procrastination essay is that it seems to assume that most of us live in a world where we can choose what to do.   would love to work on the  big problems  in my field.   am not afraid to tackle difficult problems.  he way the world works today however, it seems that only projects that have early returns are viable.  f you have a lot of money and you can work on whatever you want without worrying about money, then the essay is right on.  ut in the real world, if you want to work on a project you have to get funding.  ood luck getting funding for a  big project  that promises results in   or more years!  he ones giving you the money always want results every few months.  ou are forced to work on small problems just to prove that you are making progress.  ven in academia, you have to work on small problems so that you can write a lot of papers.  eople seem to think that it's better if someone has written    small project  papers than if he has written one  large project  paper. t would be great if we could work on big projects, but the way corporations and academia work today, you cannot do that.  ou are forced to work on small projects to get results quickly in order to satisfy the ones giving you the money.  ctually, given the fact that the quote is just one sentence of a mystery ruling, my suspicion is that the ruling was actually in the  's favor.  his is the sort of quoting out of context that wacko partisans use when they want to make a claim contrary to what the law really says.  oint taken.  f   had to discern from the reviews which movie he hated more, it would appear to be ' olf  reek' by a slight margin.   guess  'm guilty of inferring that he thought   was over the line, even though he didn't actually say it. 'm not trying to argue any point     just find it interesting to observe  oger as he occasionally puts adds a movie to that  over the line  category.  he movie ' haos' that samf pointed out is another example  actually a much better example than  . 'll probably rent ' olf  reek' sometime in the future, just to see if   agree with  oger.   have a feeling   will.  hat's the funny thing about movies made just to shock.  hey'll have made a buck off of me just because   wanted to see how depraved it was, even though   knew going in   probably would not have liked it. or what it's worth,   thought the   remake was pretty weak overall.  hanks for the link     wasn't aware of that movie.  ours is a better example of what we're talking about,   think.   is still a mess, hence the effort to clean it up in    . .  ight be too late, but good luck to them.  o, you're not the only one,  've had somewhat of the same reaction.   still enjoy the essays, but they aren't compelling to me in the way that some of  raham's earlier essays on language design were.  aybe it's just the subject matter   'm not very interested in starting a startup.  omeone who was trying to do so might find the essays on that compelling.   have always followed the idea that event based design is best when the application is input bound such as   or gui apps, as apposed to cpu bound. hey do not appear to address this consideration.  oone ever said threads are bad for everything!  ctually,   think a issue of this was featured in the movie  neakers ...   girl   know has been taking a similar contraceptive for years, except its by injection. aybe the title should be  new  oral  contraceptive..   his sucks.   have been playing it for the last   hours and it's just so stupid!    ld but entertaining.  ccording to the authors results, the difference in popularity between the programming languages aren't very big.   think it is a lot more likely that the author's methodoloy    oogling for  written in  lt language gt  rather than  lt language gt  programming    detects a very unrepresentative sample. the perl script makes this well worth it.  he analysis of  ong has been done many times by far better anthropologists than me.  he  rimal  ale, the  rimitive out of his element, technology vs. nature, etc.  hat   thought was interesting about this version doesn t have so much to do with these themes or  ackson s retelling of them, but of what the movie says about what technology can and should do in moviemaking and story telling.  ou can substitute  indows, the   archetecture, the   keyboard or anything else that's both mainstream and suboptimal for  ava and this would still be true.  eople go with what's mainstream and are slow to change.   don't think the fairly rapid move from   to  ava contradicts this, as  ava is a pretty logical evolution of  , not a paradigm shift.  ore chatter by the  o  cheerleaders.  othing to see here.  aul seems to be using  eddit to host his comment system now, so presumably there won't be for long.  he author apparently missed the entire point of the essay. ' as a great  ysadmin' isn't something   want in my obituary.  ystem administration isn't one of the great problems in  , so why do it?  he point is to do great things, not be great at doing something. nd most people won't do that, so we'll have a steady supply of sysadmins    lever in theory.  tupid in practice.  eah, right.  ead the article  he only took advantage of his bank.  hy don't you try and refute some of his points instead?  m,   enter  tring , it says   results  but only shows   results.  nd java.lang. tring is not among them...  amp    he point of the essay wasn't to say that focusing on a great project is a good thing to do.   nstead, he was explaining something about procrastination as it relates to working on a great project.   t also didn't say that someone who completes a great project is a good person, or even a successful one.    general theme of  aul's writing is great projects and how to succeed at working on one.      he question wasn't saying that you should conform to what your peers think important questions are.   t meant more that, if you believe that what you're working on is less important than something else you could be working on, you should be working on the more important thing.   homas  old probably thought what he was working on was one of the most important problems in his field, even if his peers didn't.   lso,  aul's essay is more focused inward, at how you can improve your own progress on great projects, not that you should try to convince others to do the same.  eah, right.  his is   urrently, the playback feature of  oogle  ideo isn't available in your country.  check up about a site from many sources  urely anyone who is interested in this kind of thing would have already read this article.  s reddit becoming some kind of search engine?  n  raq and  fghanistan, the  nited  tates military has more than answered the challenge given it by routing the opposing armies. pparently this is only partially true, given that the  aliban still control parts of  fghanistan and the ongoing chaos in  raq. brilliant.  rom my view, the article over emphasizes the  making  part of wealth creation and under emphasizes the selling.  t's a two part process.  ou make the stuff and you sell it.  hen the wealth flows.  t's not enough just to have users.  ou need to actually sell your product.  lternatively you can aim to be bought out by a larger firm.  n which case, you're working in partnership with the larger firm and they're handling the all important selling part.  ou're supplying ready made burgers to  c onalds, who are paying you   cents a burger and charging   to the public.  hoever handles the sales component of the wealth creation, typically recoups   of the reward.  ontrol the customer interface and you call the shots.  ok??...what did   do wrong...the google link isn't making anything any clearer?  es.  erformance is clearly quite an objective measure and verbosity is clearly quite an inherently subjective measure.  originally used only   but, after much objection from the  isp and  cheme communities,   also tried chars, words, tokens and so on.  asically, this does not change the results and, in particular, the ordering of the languages remains the same.  'll put the other graphs up at some point... heers, on  arrop.   here's no mention here of why women might not want to lose their monthly period, of thousands of years of cultural and spiritual signifigance, of what might be lost if the feminine spirit breaks her connection to the moon.   ust  ey neato idea for the modern woman on the go!   njoyed it  uthor looks at the possibility of  hiladelphia adding a big time bat like  lfonso  oriano.  hanks  aul, your style is articulate and your topic matter is tasty.  nthralling read.   truly useful piece of writing.  hank you again.  xactly.   he essay is about creative works and is applicable to artists.  othing of substance in here  his was just forwarded to me by my  on.   quote,   hope to see you soon.  elow is a nice article that made me think of you t is me.  hank you for such an intutitive article!   am going to print and frame it. aul  mbry that first one's pretty crazy, nice!  n  urope it is not that uncommon for a woman to skip a period from time to time by just continuing their contraceptive intake.  n  urope contraceptive pills are provided in   pill packs and you stop taking them for   days rather than using a placebo which, from the article, appears to be the case in the  .  o it is relatively easy to just go on to the next pack.  ikewise users of the oestrogen only so called  mini pill  usually take these   days a cycle and have reduced or no period as a result. just cant stop!   used to say  my son and daughter are 'sampling' music downloads but still buy music  s  until   realized they were only buying about   as many  s as the used to buy before it became so easy to download songs.  he  p p is good for the music industry  is really a myth   unless the industry wakes up and does the i unes kinda thing.  ome birth control pills have  placebo  pills that do still have hormones in them.  ust a different mix.  unno what the content  amp  effect is. nyway,   think skipping periods for whatever reason is a worldwide practice.  ou have mischaracterized the article. huh?  've been waiting for this for a long time now!!  greed.  lready posted twice   just search for  arnia .   know of a very good reason for authors to  not  publish their own work themselves  they don't get help with typesetting, proofreading, layout, peer review, and so on.   his article is an example of this problem, as it is riddled with bad writing and blatant errors. at least these guys are judging individual dogs by what they do, not entire breeds on mere prejudice.   work with  ussians a lot.  he situation previously where too many people were given a lot of wealth for very little really annoyed most of the people.  his is swinging things the other way and   think that sometimes the people of  ussia like to be told what to do as this has been the situation there for a very very long time the man wants to use  nome, where this issue is already addressed.  ite is down.  ont tell me we need a new word for  lashdot effect from reddit.   irrors, anyone?  ost colleges do not expect the undergraduates to be anything but cash cows to cover their other expenses.   nything that might interrupt that revenue stream, like absolute academic standards, is not tolerated.   specially in the softer departments.   oogle  arvard  rade  nflation  or  arvard  emedial  eading  for a scary history of softening standards in academia.  logging about the  tlanta business scene, business networking, entrepreneurship, venture capital, online social networking, technology, and other things that melt in the warm  tlanta sun.  hat's...   mean... in god's.... ok,   am speechless.  mean.  ude!  ick!  ool! interesting idea   ebification of a classic typography text. by no means comprehensive, but good.  hy is  aul  raham always so fixated on languages?   s long as you know basic concepts, and are smart, learning a new language is easy.   f course, it does take time to become highly proficient in a language, but excluding people because of their lack of experience with a language doesn't make any sense.   hat makes even less sense is choosing the language for your projects based on what kind of candidates you will get by using that language.  avid  ross said it best,  ighting the war on terror is like fighting a war on jealousy.    hope that vague, alarmist references to   like this don't influence people negativity about adopting technology.   kid you not, at the store the other day   made an offhand comment about the annoyance of  s at the grocery store.  he clerk lady got wide eyed and made an exclaimation about  evelations and numbering people and the end of the world is coming! lah blah blah the end of the world is near.  hatever.

'm not a fan of  est  uy by any means ... but   have to agree with jedberg ... it seems that if there was a real emergency because nature was calling, the  intellectual  could have just asked the cashier to get him verified and out the door quickly. ut instead, the author deliberately escalated the situation. aybe its just me, but   haven't been to an electronics store lately that did not check your receipt on the way out ... unless it was a mom and pop operation in a good part of town. hese kinds of situations can easily get out of hand if it kept escalating ... leading to damage, injured persons, or worse if somebody involved had a gun.  he  est  uy guy followed the author out to his car   big mistake.  oth sides in the dispute were escalating ... a recipe for disaster. on't try this at any shady camera shops in  anhattan.  ou say  his probably sounds nasty, but here's the bottom line  shoplifting and theft at stores like this is not my problem.   am not part of the problem, and   am not going to be a willing participant in your solution. ut thats like saying to the security guy at the airport   security isn't my problem.

'm not slighting  erl,  uby etc. here...it's just that  've seen how much better python is for teaching than  cheme and  ava.  ava tends to damage the future ability of potential programmers and  cheme leaves some students who would otherwise be excellent programmers in a couple years contemplating other majors. 'm a firm believer that  ,  isp and   in the third year is the way to seperate the best from the rest    his is a long video.   ay disses  tanford around the  nd or  rd minute.   o be precise, in the  rd minute, he mentions  tanford  the  nd minute is a lead up that gives his justification.  y school recently switched to a  ava   curriculum from  .  'm very thankful that   made it before the switch, because  'd hate to be one of those kids who learns  ava and then has to take an  perating  ystems course, which as  oel mentioned, is just not possible without working knowledge of  .   agree with brendankohler,   can't stand how  oel seems to insist upon high  s and elite schools.  s he running an investment bank or a software development shop?  houldn't he be looking for creative people that can brainstorm new products?   can't see how a high   and an elite school can fit that mold.  his criteria seems to fit too many kids who are killing themselves to please their parents and professors   they don't seem to be creative people who can take a mature technology and use it in a new way.   think  oel is not being able to see the different perspectives that are needed in producing a good product.  e is concentrating too much on one dimension of his candidates.  ,   think  malltalk is the best language for teaching software development.  t provides a good foundation in   principles and is very easy to learn.    back in  , when   took  perating  ystems, we didn't even have  !  e used  , which, at the time, was the interpretive language   was using to write all of their  s.  bjects?  ah! unctions?  eh! isplay terminals?  tooi!   art of the problem here might be the fact that you already have been exposed to some of his other works.  any ideas and concepts, even his style of writing, which initially seemed compelling are now  old news . lthough   think that is part of the problem for me, some of his articles are starting to feel rushed.  y most prominent example is  ow to  und a  tartup , which felt more like an encyclopedia entry than the entertaining discourse to which   am accustomed.  anotechnology, biotech and technology investments focusing in the  sraeli  arket.  echnology  eview picks five important advances in nanotechnology and materials science in     and one policy issue that could decide the future of the entire field.    congratulate  atz to his humbleness. he changes seem pretty harsh though.  opefully  ails will be ported     dunno,   think  oogle is pretty creative. and that's just not cool.   think the most interesting point in the essay is that  oel wants to hire people from, eg.  uke, but is worried about doing so because it is hard to tell the  uke students who don't understand recursion because they have only coded in java from the  uke students who just aren't smart enough to recurse.   his is supposed to be part of what college is for, but since the   depts are dropping the ball, there is a niche open for a sort of  e ry for cool languages and techniques, where you can prove competence in scheme, haskell, asm, etc., instead of with java.   he placement rates post graduation for such an institution would probably be excellent, assuming anyone passed.    guess it would have to be set up like a certification or something similar, because the size of the student body would not justify a school scale operation.   erhaps local language organizations like  isp  and  othton would be the proper vehicle.  owa  tate  niversity, while a fine place in many ways, teaches  ava to   freshmen in such a boringly basic way that  oel's words on  taking multiple choice quizzicles on the difference between polymorphism and overloading  rang very true.  f you want a good introductory programming class at  , try    .  t teaches   programming for   freshmen, and it's well done. f   had my way, the   introductory class would use   and water it down as much as necessary instead of this silly  ava monkey factory class they feed the   students.   find this article a bit frustrating.   at least agree with him on the values of teaching pointers and functional languages, but trivializing  oftware  ngineering concepts and dismissing them to be nothing more than memory games?  hat's a bit reckless. orrect me if  'm wrong, but it sounds like he's complaining about how there's a lack of challenge in the obstacles used to train the code commandos that he deems fit for hiring.   drones?  hat about the drones earlier in the assembly line who are at the mercy of academic opinion? uestion   o   arrow down if   think this shouldn't go on the 'hot' page or if   think the article is crappy?   es,  mnesty  nternational are being targeted as  anti foreigner  and racist...  unny!   nd sad.   fter  orman  chwarzkopf pointed out  heney's stupidity, how did the guy stay in public life?   is high level?

  ou can tighten the angle once you get going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to the wind once it gets underway.  fear a lot of your readership won't  sailing close to the wind , having never sailed a boat.   ince you used it again in your kickoff paragraph, perhaps you should clarify it some?  angauges  is spelled 'languages.    pelling is important when you program a translator, let alone any other web app.   ellow commentees  don't bore me with comments about  you modded this down because of spelling  because in fact,   didn't. eeks have the worst spelling ever, in my experience.   ost of them are too proud to hire a good copyeditor or proofreader.   akes you wonder how much the geek audience appreciates excellence. what does web two point oh have to do with anything like this?

ot that  'm a conspiracy theorist or anything but  'd love to know ?  a.   ow.  orons.  f course there's no money in it.  f course it's a delusion.  nd if this guy ever worked in one of these joints in his life before this, he would have handily disabused himself of this romantic farce.   love coffee, and cafes, and sitting in cafes drinking coffee while tinkering on my laptop, but   never pretend to want to run one of these places because   worked in one part time in high school.  t was stressful and bland and low paying enough without having to worry about equity in the joint.  ut, when you're an overeducated, understimulated dilettante,   guess you have the time and money to dabble in this nonsense.  ntil, well, you have neither.  nd then the nitwit has the gall to assume his myopic lower east side fantasy was a labor of love?  ere's the difference between someone doing something they love and someone having a midlife crisis   hen their first attempt fails, the lovers collect themselves, find some more money, and go do it again.  he fantasists throw up their hands and write a monologue about their troubles as a cautionary tale. igures the guy writes for  itchfork and  irkus.  o you are seriously saying that the government is tolerating murders 'under a banner of cultural sensitivity'?  our links were informative but   don't see how they could lead to this conclusion.  nd devoid of content. well said.   ame.  hoever voted for this, go away to digg please.   couldn't help but think of  oug  ngelbart and how he asked himself,  ow can my career maximize my contribution to mankind?     think that falls right in line with  amming's question, and it's something   think about quite a bit.   f course, like some of the other posters,   suffer from not having enough  spare time.   ow a  aturalized    itizen,   can attest to   arrogance first hand  ruthless, insensitive, unhelpful, high handed.   rimetime something is done about  .   ity   victims have no voice in  .  reat reply thanks.   s to technical points just about every package system has namespaces.   ython, perl, and  ommon  isp all do.   o   think just about every language community has figured out that they are a good idea.   eck, even scheme is adding a package system for  .   s java's different somehow? s to your experience in the  . are the students allowed to use other languages, or merely other dev environments?   o you know when and why they switched from x to java?   like how the article equates alcohol prohibition to insider trading, and says that should be allowed too.   he whole article is about how despite reducing alcohol consumption, it created more problems than it solved  to judge it we must look at all the effects.   ut in the intro the author implies that nothing should be economically prohibited  so much for weighing costs and benefits.  his article is written like   would think opening a neighborhood coffee shop would be a great idea, but   really wouldn't so the guy just sounds like a moron to me.  oesn't mean the threads aren't native.  ust look at  tackless.  ure, that is.   ut the fact that there was a remote root out there for   for   of   is not surprising?    knew it was bad, but not that bad.  efinitely an interesting and refreshing approach. 've always liked the fact that   considers  ails  opinionated software  and realizes that he can't please everyone.  e creates what he wants and thus avoids bloat and unecessary complexity.   seriously doubt you judge institutions solely on policy.  sure hope you are correct that such crimes are aggressively being prosecuted and that cultural leaders are acting to prevent further harm from coming to these women.  hy do big companies keep threatening little guys who write positive things about them?  hose are the ugliest shirts   have ever seen.  o   spent   minutes of watching a guy say yes to get to the  funny  part of a guy cussing?  hat are we,  ?  agree, go back to  igg.  eat trick but my first impression is that   would rapidly find it annoying when trying to click through a lot of images on a site. uh. so you show the image, and then your users click  back  because that's what they're used to, and then they've left your page. brilliant.  his stuff is good to know.   ust in case...   think it is important to mention that one of the most important benefits of procrastination is that you can sometimes gets someone else to do the errands for you if you procrastinate long enough.   his results in your being able to do the  big stuff  while someone else, i.e. spouse or family member, squanders their life doing the  small stuff.   eah, very unbiased.    earing up for  ...  xcellent concept. democracy? it sounds more like communism, and the web  .  its the manifest, soon tobe explode in the face of thier belivers. i cant see,why the big players,will not perssue to  to be monpolist in this game. google is sharping it claws and soon we all gonna feel it.  n awesome collection.  eminds me of the classic    attern  anguage   owns,  uildings,  onstruction  book by  .  lexander et al.  sn't this a spin on communism?  aving worked in an  open plan office  the interuptions were mega and every one seemed to procastinate ry painting the mind is totally absorbed  to the exclusion of everything around you.    do however leave lists for my husband a great procastinator!!  reat, simple and effective exercises.  his is a truly great resource.   found it  broke rapidly when playing with the browser window size.   ore in depth testing...?   can vouch for that thing about parenting.   software developer has released a tsunami advance warning application for mobile phones serving countries bordering the  ndian  cean.   esus  hrist.  rom the article   ut take a look around.  he crowd at a racing track does an uncannily good job of forecasting the outcome, better in fact than just about any single bettor can do.  orses that go off at  to  odds win a quarter of the time, horses that go off at  to  win a seventh of the time, and so on. oes the author realize that the odds are set by the bookees and the bettors are losing.  hat doesn't support his argument at all.  r perhaps it's not because of the   at all   recently had the opportunity to interview  houtwire founder  ustin  unnell about the inspiration behind his site and the current state and future of social news promotion.  he online article misses the funny thing about the printed version.  n one page, they had the title  as  arwin  rong? ...turn the page... n huge, four inch tall letters   .  hmmm ... i wonder what you're alluding to. i for one, i'm voting this down.  lease.   is main bone of contention seems to be that singletons are stupid because he used to do stupid things with them   used them for things they shouldn't have been used for. hen he  discovered  static methods, which made him realize that he was using singletons stupidly.   xcuse me, which made him realize that singletons are stupid. ow, what a superb programmer, with such a well thought position.  ust some guy ranting, move along, nothing to see here...  his is how the left needs to approach political elections  as marketing to different segmnets using correct media for each.  elax, it's funny.   have never been a fan of dell quality.  ut of late it seems to have taken a turn for the worse.  hey wouldn't need to do support on the cheap if they had reasonable products.        !           !      ook at the author's creditials   looks like pure propaganda to me.   o you really believe everything you read without question and without consideration for context?    f you really want to verify the truth, check out a global human rights watch website.   ot saying that these figures are wrong per se, but considering points   and     suspect this article was printed at this time to boost confidence in your government.    f   amount of people were murdered last year, and less than  was murdered this year, does it therefore follow that murder is ok?  guess we can all feel good about the world in that case.   arry on.  gh, it's dynamically scoped.   haven't worked with dynamic scoping much, but   don't envy people trying to serious work in it. dit   eah, yeah, the compiled version is lexically scoped,   should have read the next line.   don't think it is a good approach, though.  t's a good question.  e know it's not  slam and we know that it has happened in many societies.  o you have a theory? h, could it be that some men are psycho control freaks, and any excuse will do?   ow dare you not obey my every demand and refuse to worship the ground   walk on!?   ou do not do these things   ask of you  therefore the  lying  pagetti  onster requires   kill you.  his is kind of old... funny, but old.   o we really need to post everything that was passed around in   by chain letters?  he pharmicutical industry is corrupt beyond belief.   ust google  ig pharma  for more info than you could read in   lifetimes.  here seems to be a problem right now...  he difference between the left and the right is that the right actually respects the left as an adversary.   nd that is why they win.  his is a great reference to keep handy for all those times you hear someone name the   as part of the  ecular  ar on  hristianity. .... eah, if you want to amuse others with your gullibility in buying these examples of cynically calculated  exceptions to the rule .  he   is reprehensible.  t may be old, but it was discussed for an hour or more on  erry  pringer's  ir  merica talk show recently.   ome folks took it seriously especially from the  outh.  es and it looks like they had good reason not to trust you.  gain.   elax.   t's funny.   heesh.
